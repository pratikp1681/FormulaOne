# FormulaOne
This is a project in data cleaning and analysis where we have tried to generate interesting insights about the sport of Formula One.

The .csv files have been cleaned, and manipulated using Pyhton. The code for that can be found in the Jupyter notebook.

The .ipynb has the complete project. There might be issues in rendering live visualizations through GitHUb. Kindly download and run to view the analyses.
